Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
-
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.

MY SOLUTION.
I defined variable 'n' for taking integral input from the user
Then, i have used the MOD function for defining 'odd' numbers and 'even' numbers.
At last, I have used conditions for printing output as even or odd number.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
-
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

MY SOLUTION.
I have defined variable 'n' for taking the integral input from the user, which will be used as upper limit for addition of natural numbers.
Then. I have defined the range from 1 to n ( 'n' inclusive as range = {1, n+1}) 
At last, i have defined the for loop for iterating over i for all values in the given range.
